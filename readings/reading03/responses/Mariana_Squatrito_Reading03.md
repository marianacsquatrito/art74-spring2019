Response to The Power of Visual Storytelling 

When it comes to graphic design or digital media it is easy for the artist to either, design a project that is too broad and does not give enough information or design something that only suites the artists preferences. The Power of Visual Storytelling aims to help define the importance of understanding the “target group”. For example, the article explains how you should use an editorial approach when targeting a broad audience. For more targeted audiences, one will want to use a brand-centric approach. 

Each type of communication has its limitations. Editorial advertising, for instance, wants to target as large of a group as possible but has two different methods of doing so. These are thought leadership and virality: they often do not mesh well together. If the goal is virality, the infographic should have a minimal amount of information in order not to overwhelm the broad audience. The downfall is that some people may miss important details about the product. Brand Centric advertising will only influence a targeted group.
